What was done so far:

The following files were mostly implemented: Function.h Symbol.h SymbolTable.h.
Bare skeleton was written for Buffer.h



TODO:
1. Define and handle exceptions in Function.h Symbol.h SymbolTable.h.
2. Implement Buffer.h.
3. Understand markers and backpatching
4. We should start work on common.y file ASAP.


Last stage:
* RELOPS : != , == , < , >
* BEXP: NOT, AND
* Return value type
* Error messages
* Clean code from extra prints
* Documentation
* Bugs :)
